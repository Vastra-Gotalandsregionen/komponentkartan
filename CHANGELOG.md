## 0.3.0 (2017-11-07)

### Description of release
This release includes improved structure for both pages and lists. The aim is to make it simple to create a new page and add content.
*Note*: Introducing more structure means that some flexibility is lost. This is to support out known UX-designs in a simpler way.

### List component (former expandable-container-list)
- Expandable-container-list is replaced by list
- added property flexibleHeader. This is a replacement for the former class "list--inline", that will be set by the property instead
- removed Back-to-top component from the list, see section below.
- Addded new tags for more structure on the list. Vgr-list-header, vgr-list-column, vgr-list-column-header are added.
- Sorting added
- Automatic width adjustment of list columns based on header width

### Back-to-top
- No longer exists in the list component, add it on your app.component.html to enable it

### Page structure
- A page is now constructed by using vgr-page, vgr-page-header, vgr-page-body and vgr-page-block
- An action-panel can be added to the page by adding a vgr-action-panel on the page. When expanded, it drops down from the page header.

### DropdownComponent, DropdownMultiSelectComponent
- Readonly mode is changed to allow longer text to be displayed
- Animation added when transitioning between readonly true/false

### DatepickerComponent, MonthpickerComponent
- Animation added when transitioning between readonly true/false


## 0.2.0 (2017-10-24)

### Description of release
In this release we foucsed on standarization of property names, class names and tags.
We also added validation to a number of components. **NOTE!** there are breaking changes due to names changing. Please see each component below for a detailed description.

### CardSectionComponent
- renamed subTitle to subtitle
- renamed editMode to readonly with default value true
### CheckboxComponent
- renamed text to label
### MonthpickerComponent
- renamed preselectedDate to selectedDate
- added validation with property required
### DatepickerComponent
- added validation with property required
### TextButtonComponent/ButtonComponent
- renamed TextButtonComponent to ButtonComponent
- renamed TextButtonComponent selector from vgr-text-button to vgr-button
- renamed TextButtonComponent.buttonClick to click
- renamed all css classes concerning .text-button to .button
- internally, the button now listens to MouseDown instead of Click. The component still publishes Click as an event. This is due to validation components and the ordering of onBlur, onFocus, onClick and onMouseDown.
### LockButtonComponent
- changed events onLocked() and onUnlocked() to lockChanged(locked : boolean)
### DropdownComponent
- SelectAllSelectedText and SelectAllItemText has been removed

- SelectAllSelectedText has been replaced with noItemSelectedLabel.
- noItemSelectedLabel is shown in the dropdown when no item is selected.
- It is no longer possible to deselect item once one is selected. You can still reselect something.
- added validation with property required
### DropdownMultiselectComponent
- renamed displayAllItemsText to showAllItemText
